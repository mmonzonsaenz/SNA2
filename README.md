Hello! Welcome to the repository for our project, "Interaction Networks within the Russian Political Opposition"!

Here is the link to our website: https://mmonzonsaenz.github.io/SNA2/index.html 

We've laid out our annotated code with graphs on the home page and included extra tabs for you to be able to retrace our work (Pure Code, Dataset generation, Data Analysis, and access to our raw data).

We do not have experience with coding and have struggled with fixing the nav bar fully for hours; hopefully you'll appreciate our humble first try at building a website from scratch!

We hope you enjoy the project.

This project was done by: Sarah Hinteregger, Martina Monzon, Kira Rodionova, and Ailing Meng.
