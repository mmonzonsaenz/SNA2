<h2>First Step</h2>
<p>After uploading the libraries and identifying the most popular tags, we categorize the tags into four categories and assign each category an axis:</p>

<pre>
Our code:
import pandas as pd
# Load your top tags
top_tags_df = pd.read_csv('top_tags.csv')
# Define the categories, their tags, and their coordinates
categories = {
    "Putin": {
        "tags": ['путин', 'владимир путин'],
        "coordinates": (1, 0)
    },
    "Navalny+FBK": {
        "tags": ['фбк', 'навальный', 'певчих', 'фонд борьбы с коррупцией', 'волков', 'сериал',
'алексей навальный'],
        "coordinates": (0, 1)
    },
    "What happened in 1990s?": {
        "tags": ['предатели', 'ходорковский', 'абрамович', 'ельцин'],
        "coordinates": (-1, 0)
    },
    "Trump’s role": {
        "tags": ['трамп', 'переговоры'],
        "coordinates": (0, -1)
    }
}
# Prepare lists to build a new DataFrame
organized_tags = []
for index, row in top_tags_df.iterrows():
    tag = row['Tag'].strip().lower()
    count = row['Count']
    found = False
    for category, data in categories.items():
        if tag in data['tags']:
            organized_tags.append({
                'Tag': tag,
                'Count': count,
                'Category': category,
                'Coordinates': data['coordinates']
            })
            found = True
            break
    if not found:
        pass
# Create a new DataFrame
categorized_tags_df = pd.DataFrame(organized_tags)
# Save it to a CSV
categorized_tags_df.to_csv('categorized_tags_with_coordinates.csv', index=False)
print("Done! Saved categorized tags to 'categorized_tags_with_coordinates.csv'")
</pre>

<p>After executing this step, we have this file = categorized_tags.csv - this file contains info about what category we have attributed to every tag. And we have this file = Categorized_tags_with_coordinates.csv - this file has tags, categories, and coordinates for every video.</p>

<h2>Second Step</h2>
<p>Now, we design a code that creates a dictionary that provides for every tag specific coordinates in a python format. The coordinates are calculated based on the average of all tags attributed to one video. We visualize it into a graph.</p>

<pre>
Our code:
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Load videos and categorized tags
...
plt.show()
</pre>

<p>The Graph we see:</p>
<img src="sna_graph_step_5.png" alt="Initial Graph in Russian">

<p>We have decided to translate it into English. To do so, We have uploaded the translating library and translated all tags from Russian into English.</p>

<pre>
Our code:
import pandas as pd
from deep_translator import GoogleTranslator
...
print(" Done! Translated tags saved to 'categorized_tags_with_coordinates_translated.csv'")
</pre>

<p>Now, we have this file = 'categorized_tags_with_coordinates_translated.csv' with all tags, being categorized and translated into english. We note that now, the relevant tags can be found under a column named Tag_English.</p>

<p>Now, we run the same code to produce a graph but using English tags, and also adjusting the size of the nodes to a slightly bigger one.</p>

<img src="sna_graph_step_4.png" alt="Graph with English Tags, Step 2 Updated">

<p>We really liked this graph. We liked everything about it. However, the titles are overlapping each other making it impossible to read them. We have decided to make the font a bit bigger, and make sure there are no overlappings of the titles.</p>

<p>To do so, we have uploaded a special library for text adjustment, and then used it to make sure the titles don’t overlap.</p>

<pre>
Our code:
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from adjustText import adjust_text
...
plt.show()
</pre>

<p>Our graph:</p>
<img src="sna_graph_step_3.png" alt="Graph with Adjusted Text (No Overlap)">

<h2>Third Step</h2>
<p>We identify all channels that have uploaded the videos which we are analyzing, and collect them into the file named unique_channels.csv. Then, we attribute to every unique channel a color. We make sure that the color is not in the [n.p.float64] format but in a format convenient to use the library matplotlib in the future. Because Kira learns from her mistakes.</p>

<pre>
Our code:
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
...
plt.show()
</pre>

<p>We have this nice picture and this file = videos_with_colors.csv - which contains video Id, channel, and color.</p>

<img src="sna_graph_step_2.png" alt="Step 3 - Channel Color Mapping">

<h2>Fourth Step</h2>
<p>Here, we merge our most important file = videos.csv with videos_with_colors.csv - to create a file which will unite: Video ID, Channel, and Color. (Simultaneously, we make sure that the titles don’t overlap and the data about the tags is extracted from the English version)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we again run into the problem with the colors. We had to upload an additional Library named numpy to fix it.</p>

<pre>
Our code:
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from adjustText import adjust_text
import matplotlib.colors as mcolors
import numpy as np
...
plt.show()
</pre>

<p>Our Graph:</p>
